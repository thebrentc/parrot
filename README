SLEEPING PARROTS

GOAL

Provides a means for users to access a 'secret' on demand without having to manage additional user logon details.

The analogy is parrots are "sleeping" until awoken, when they deliver their secrets and also broadcast that they have been awakened. It's a digital 'sealed envelope' solution- users with access to the envelope can open it but it's obvious that the seal has been broken.

HOW IT WORKS

Users are linked to parrots by email address. When they enter their email address, they can choose to wake a relevant parrot. The secret is then emailed to the user that woke the parrot, and the parrot also notifies other users linked to that parrot that it has been awakened.

Secrets can be 'shared' amongst a group, so that each user only receives, for example 50% of the secret, requiring more than one user to obtain the full secret.

DISCLAIMERS

It's intended for convenience rather than strong security.
The code is not robust and consideration should be applied if deploying.

TECHNICAL

Programmed in Perl version 5.8.8.

FILES

Start: cgi-bin/index.cgi or cgi-in/index.shtml

cgi-bin/parrot = contains Perl script files
cgi-bin/parrot.ini = Settings e.g. file and data locations
cgi-bin/parrotdata = users.csv, parrot.log and Parrot files
users.csv = Links user emails to Parrot files

FOR WEB DEPLOYMENT:
cgi-bin/.htaccess = Default .htaccess which may need tweaking or moving 
cgi-bin/index.cgi is modified to allow SSI inclusion in .html or .shtml files, but this hasn't been extended to other .cgi files in cgi-bin.
cgi-bin/index.shtml sample file includes index.cgi, normally may be in a different directory outside cgi-bin

Ideally, ./parrotdata should be moved outside web root.

USAGE

There is currently no database integration or administrative interface.

Users and linked parrots need to be manually added to parrotdata/users.csv
Parrot files need to be manually created in parrotdata/
To reset user-parrot accesses, clear the relevant lines in parrotdata/parrot.log
